					<h3>Growing potatos</h3>
				</div>
				<p>The crops are harvested from the specific varietals of the potato tuber expertly chosen by the farmers. Initially, they chop seed potatoes into fragments while ensuring each one bears an 'eye' or sprout, ensuring proper growth. These parts are planted in rows doused in loose, well-drained soil with a few inches of dirt on top. Throughout the growth of the plants, mounding soil is added to stems to conceal the potatoes from harmful sunlight which can turn them green and toxic. While potatoes do require a consistent supply of water, over watering should be avoided at all costs. The crops and plants are abandoned until they start to yellow and die off. At this point, harvesting can commence. They are carefully dug out, cured to strengthen the skin, and are then stored in a cold, dark place for optimal freshness.</p>

						<h3>Potato Soup</h3>
						<p>Make sure to preheat your stove while chopping the garlic and the onions into fine pieces: add butter to the pan. Once it melts, add the garlic first, wait for it to brown before putting the onions. Leave it on the stove until the onions are translucent. Add in the potatoes that have already been diced, followed closely by either vegetable or chicken broth. Leave it to simmer, waiting for the potatoes to tenderize: blend it after. For a more nourishing feel, try leaving some chunks in the mixture. After blending, add in either milk or cream for richer taste and mix with thyme or parsley, salt and pepper to season it. The creamy potato soup recipe has several health benefits which include the prevention of heart diseases and ensuring proper digestion. This is because potatoes are rich in vitamins such as B6, C, potassium and even fiber. Potato soup is the ultimate remedy to boost energy and staying full, which is why it is fantastic.</p>

						<h3>Potato Salad</h3>
						<p>To start with the recipe for a flavorful potato salad, some potatoes should be boiled until soft yet still firm, after which they should be cooled and roughly chopped into small pieces. Add a mixture of greek yogurt or mayonnaise to them for further creaminess, and for a tangy kick, add mustard along with some diced onions, crunchy celery, and hard boiled eggs for an addition of protein. Parsley and chives also add additional flavoring when combined with salt and pepper. Not only are potatoes beneficial for digestion, inflammation, and heart health, they also provide much needed fiber along with vitamins C and B6 and potassium. Substituting mayonnaise with greek yogurt helps get rid of bad fats and adds a plethora of healthy probiotics. This meal can be enjoyed as a delightful and healthy side!.</p>

				<p>Potatoes are processed into vodka in a multistep process. Initially, the potatoes are cleaned by washing to remove dirt, after which they are then boiled and changed into a starchy pulp. The addition of enzymes or malted grains changes the starches into fermentable sugars. Yeast is added to start fermentation, which can take several days to change the sugars into alcohol. This wash is distilled multiple times to rid itself of a myriad of impurities, bringing a very smooth concentration of the alcohol. Lastly, filtered distilled spirits will get rid of remaining impurities, after which dilution with water follows, until desired alcoholic contents yield fine potato vodka, so soft in style.</p>

					<h3>Different types of Potatos</h3>
				</div>
				<p>There are many types of potatoes that differ in flavor, texture, and nutritional content. Popular types include Russet, Yukon Gold, Red, Purple, and Fingerling potatoes. Baking is combined with the highest starch type – Russet potatoes. On the other hand, waxy potatoes like Red and Fingerling type are ideal firmer textures for boiling and salads. Nutritionally, all potatoes provide different vitamins and minerals with some being better than others. For instance, purple potatoes are known to possess antioxidants which aid in heart health while growing herbs has been observed to contain more vitamin C than russets. Sweet potatoes are different species entirely but do contain a higher level of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. Even non-starchy potatoes like purple, red flesh, and russet provide diverse health benefits of potassium, carbohydrates, fiber, and nutrients, all while keeping blood pressure in check.</p>
