					<h3>Growing potatoes</h3>
					<p>The crops are harvested from the specific varietals of the potato tuber expertly chosen by the farmers. Initially, they chop seed potatoes into fragments while ensuring each one bears an 'eye' or sprout, ensuring proper growth. These parts are planted in rows doused in loose, well-drained soil with a few inches of dirt on top. Throughout the growth of the plants, mounding soil is added to stems to conceal the potatoes from harmful sunlight which can turn them green and toxic. While potatoes do require a consistent supply of water, over watering should be avoided at all costs. The crops and plants are abandoned until they start to yellow and die off. At this point, harvesting can commence. They are carefully dug out, cured to strengthen the skin, and are then stored in a cold, dark place for optimal freshness.</p>

						<h3>Turning Potatoes into Vodka</h3>
						<p>Potatoes are processed into vodka in a multistep process. Initially, the potatoes are cleaned by washing to remove dirt, after which they are then boiled and changed into a starchy pulp. The addition of enzymes or malted grains changes the starches into fermentable sugars. Yeast is added to start fermentation, which can take several days to change the sugars into alcohol. This wash is distilled multiple times to rid itself of a myriad of impurities, bringing a very smooth concentration of the alcohol. Lastly, filtered distilled spirits will get rid of remaining impurities, after which dilution with water follows, until desired alcoholic contents yield fine potato vodka, so soft in style.</p>

						<h3>Different types of Potatoes</h3>
						<p>There are many types of potatoes that differ in flavor, texture, and nutritional content. Popular types include Russet, Yukon Gold, Red, Purple, and Fingerling potatoes. Baking is combined with the highest starch type – Russet potatoes. On the other hand, waxy potatoes like Red and Fingerling type are ideally firmer textures for boiling and salads. Nutritionally, all potatoes provide different vitamins and minerals with some being better than others. For instance, purple potatoes are known to possess antioxidants which aid in heart health while growing herbs has been observed to contain more vitamin C than russets. Sweet potatoes are different species entirely but do contain a higher level of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. Even non-starchy potatoes like purple, red flesh, and russet provide diverse health benefits of potassium, carbohydrates, fiber, and nutrients, all while keeping blood pressure in check.</p>

						<h3>Warning when dealing with potatoes</h3>
						<p>It is very important to be aware of the dangers of bad potatoes, for they can serve as a conduit to serious health concerns. The potatoes may have turned and sprouted in excess or perhaps have developed a rotten smell and could contain very high levels of solanine-a natural toxin responsible for nausea, headaches, and even neurological problems when consumed in large amounts. Moreover, moldy or mushy potatoes can be a real breeding ground for some pretty nasty bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Keep potatoes cool and dark, always discarding any showing signs of spoilage. Never eat potatoes if they taste bitter or have a off-putting texture. Keeping an eye on the quality of potatoes is vital for good eating and good health.</p>

				<h3>A Crispy Take on Portuguese Punched Potatoes</h3>
				<p>In the June 8, 2024, edition of The Guardian newspaper's "How to turn leftover cooked potatoes into a Portuguese classic—recipe," chef and anti-waste campaigner Tom Hunt illustrates a new and innovative way of preserving leftover cooked potatoes. This simple and tasty recipe for traditional Portuguese punched potatoes (batatas a murro) is not only a wonderful reinterpretation of the dish but also a banquet of flavor and texture and of green cuisine as well.</p>
				<p>He presents the recipe as one he has included in the menu of his Bristol restaurant, the Poco Tapas Bar, for a decade or more. It's a technique, however, not quite as simple as it is sounding: you squash cooked potatoes so that the skin cracks and the inside is fluffy, and roast them under the oven's warmth in olive oil until crispy and golden. It's a dish of texture and contrast.</p>
				<p>The potatoes become impossibly crispy in every crevice, and the fluffiness inside is counterpointed by the roughness of the caramel-tinged, crispy skin, a highly satisfying set of textures," writes Hunt of the dish. Such textural richness and alchemy promote the dish to solo star rather than side dish status.</p>
				<p>Secondly, Hunt proposes ways of increasing the dish's efficiency in the use of energy by cooking it in batches or, alternatively, by using the air fryer. Hunt further proposes seasoning the potatoes using a combination of garlic, a pinch of lemon zest, a pinch of paprika, and herbs, which provide flavor dimension and can further be adjusted according to the meal in question. This recipe is also a wonderful reminder that leftovers needn't be so dull. Last night's potato, with a little creativity and effort, can become tomorrow's flavor sensation.</p>

				<p>My favorite place to go to have a picnic in Edmonton is Beaumaris Lake because of the view and mainly all of the geese there to feed and watch swim. For directions to Beaumaris Lake, around the TELUS World of Science, go straight north up until you hit Henry Singer Park, then go right; after turning, go straight until 121st on 153 Ave NW, then turn left. Take 157 Ave NW until Castle Downs Rd NW, then turn right, then park. You are there.</p>
